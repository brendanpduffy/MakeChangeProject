## Make Change Project

### Description

This is project take inputs of item's price and money tendered and then returns the appropriate change with the largest bill and coin denominations as possible.

### Topics and Technologies Used

* Conditionals (if/else)
* Math.round(change)
* casting double to int

### How to Run

Enter amount of item and the amount of money tendered.


### Lessons Learned
* I made numQ a double (instead of an int) early on and forgot about it and it was causing problems.  15 minutes of troubleshooting could have been saved if I had just scrolled up and reexamined my early assumptions.

* I had a fork where it worked for some conditions but not others.  So I commented out both options next to each other and it made explaining the problem a lot easier when asking for help.
